First, we verify that existing low-rank methods are applicable to prompt decoding with low approximation error, both theoretically and empirically. Second, we unearth and implement efficient decoding algorithms from literature across various fields. Moreover, we propose a linear-complexity algorithm that achieves SOTA time and memory efficiency, and make an IO-aware implementation by Triton."
